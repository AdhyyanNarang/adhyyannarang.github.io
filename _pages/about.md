I am  a fourth year PhD Student in the [ECE Department](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) of University of Washington, advised by [Prof. Maryam Fazel](https://faculty.washington.edu/mfazel/) and [Prof. Lillian Ratliff](http://faculty.washington.edu/ratliffl/about/). During my PhD, I have also had the good fortune to collaborate closely with Prof.Jeff Bilmes and Prof.Kevin Jamieson.

My work is aimed towards the development of Holistic Artificial Intelligence: AIs that can integrate smoothly and **harmoniously** into the natural and economic systems that they are a part of, and provide sustained value over the long-term.
The traditional framing of value-alignment between AIs and humans is necessary to achieve this goal. However, Holistic AI also concerns itself with factors such as robustness, flexibility/adaptability, resource efficiency and smooth co-operation between multiple (artificial/human) agents.

Towards this lofty goal, my PhD work extends tools from traditional game theory and statistics to formalize what Holistic AI may look like for specific modern ML systems; see the 'Publications' tab for further details. I was also fortunate to intern at Amazon in the summers of 2022 and 2023 to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Prior to joining UW, I completed my Masters in 2020 in the [BLISS Lab](http://bliss.eecs.berkeley.edu/) in the [EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) department at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), where I was advised by Prof. Anant Sahai. My master's thesis explored the role of margins for overparameterized classification problems and can be found [here](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2020/EECS-2020-116.pdf).
I completed my undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley with a major in EECS and minor in Theater and Performance Studies.
