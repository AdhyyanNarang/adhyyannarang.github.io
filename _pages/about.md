I am completing my PhD in the [ECE Department](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington, advised by [Prof. Maryam Fazel](https://faculty.washington.edu/mfazel/) and [Prof. Lillian Ratliff](http://faculty.washington.edu/ratliffl/about/) (expected graduation: Spring 2026). During my PhD, I have also had the good fortune to collaborate closely with Prof. Jeff Bilmes and Prof. Kevin Jamieson. **I am on the industry job market**

**My research studies how ML systems behave when they interact with humans and with each other**, and how to ensure those interactions are safe and beneficial. This spans game-theoretic frameworks for multi-agent learning, empirical work on manipulation and deception in LLM optimization, and foundational questions in learning theory. See the [Publications](/publications/) tab for the full list.

Prior to joining UW, I completed my Masters in 2020 in the [BLISS Lab](http://bliss.eecs.berkeley.edu/) in the [EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) department at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), where I was advised by Prof. Anant Sahai. I completed my undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley with a major in EECS and minor in Theater and Performance Studies.
